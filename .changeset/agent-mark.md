Avatar agent: Bridge now draws its own agent mark (a prompt chevron and cursor line, Deep Harbor on a Harbor rounded square tile) instead of shipping the Claude logo, which is an Anthropic trademark. `brand="claude"` still works and keeps the name "Claude AI". New `AGENT_MARK` export; `CLAUDE_MARK` stays as a deprecated alias of it. New optional `mark` prop for a vendor logo you have the brand owner's approval to use. The agent tile token `color.agent.surface` now follows the Harbor zone in every theme and brand. The Figma UI kit gets a Kind axis (person, agent) drawing the new mark, and the spec generator keeps an SVG line join.
