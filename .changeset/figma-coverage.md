Honest Figma coverage. `npm run specs` now reads every component folder and records each one in a `coverage` list of component-specs.json: generated, unsupported with the generator's plain reason ("opens a popup", "uses CSS grid", "shows content computed while the page runs"), or a layout helper with nothing to draw. Support is decided by the generator from what it can read, no list to maintain. The plugin Pull tab says "26 of 47 components are in Figma" with the others folded under the count, each with its reason, and the Studio Components page shows a quiet "In Figma" column from the same data.

Coverage goes from 6 to 26 of 47 visual components. The generator draws 19 more (Accordion, Alert, Avatar, Banner, Breadcrumb, Checkbox, CheckboxGroup, ChoiceCard, CodeBlock, Divider, Field, Kbd, Link, NumberField, RadioGroup and Radio, SegmentedControl, Skeleton, Switch, Textarea), and Icon counts as covered by the icon components of the Icons page. New general capabilities: content props as TEXT and BOOLEAN properties, Base UI checked states as a Checked axis, layers hidden per variant, translateX and row-reverse read as auto layout, flex grow and wrap, lists and selections from the docs preview, the page base stylesheet, em sizes, underlines, opacity, fixed and per-variant icons, images as the media slot, useRender links. Fixes from the fidelity check: a transparent border keeps its room (a transparent stroke counted in layout), link buttons are underlined, inherited typography reaches every text.
