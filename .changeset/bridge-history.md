History and rollback. `bridge_get_history` and `bridge_get_token_history` read what changed in the tokens (versions, merged PRs and commits, who, when, why, tier, breaking), and `bridge_plan_revert` and `bridge_propose_revert` undo a change against the current base branch, with conflicts shown when a token changed again later, or restore one token to an older value. The CLI adds `bridge history [token]` and `bridge revert <pr|commit> [--dry-run]`. Built on the new history model and revert planner in `@bridge/core`.
