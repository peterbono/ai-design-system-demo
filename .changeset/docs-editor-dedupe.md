Docs proposals: one open proposal per component. Sending docs for a component that already has an open docs proposal adds a commit to it instead of opening a second pull request (`proposeDocsOnGitHub` returns `continued`, and `unchanged` when it already says the same). New core helpers `findOpenDocsProposal`, `findOpenDocsProposalOnGitHub`, `isDocsProposalBranch`, `continueDocsProposalOnGitHub` and `docsSlug`, shared by the Library editor and the MCP server (`bridge_save_docs` without `pr` continues the open one). The Library editor opens on the open proposal ("Continues the open proposal by ..., waiting for review", with a link to its review), and Send is off with "Nothing changed since the open proposal" when the text is the same.

Attribution: the pull request's author line now says who wrote the text (`docsAuthorLine`, `withAuthorLine`, `defaultDocsFooter`): "Drafted by Claude AI, reviewed and sent by @person" when Claude's draft goes out as written, "Drafted by Claude AI, edited by @person" with the edited sections, and "No AI involved" only when no Claude draft is in the text. The editor tracks the text Claude wrote per section (`authorship`).
