Studio cleanup. Changes: the "In review" tab is now "All changes", its status filter is one Select named after the status model (All open, Draft, Ready for review, Approved waiting for code, Shipped, Closed), and the "try together" checkboxes appear only after "Choose changes", so the first screen holds about half the controls. A change detail keeps one ship control: Ship sits on the title line once the change can ship, and the disabled Ship in the action bar is gone, as is "Reply on GitHub". Tokens: on a phone the type chips get their own line and every brand and theme stacks into labeled lines; the draft bar reserves room so it never covers the last rows; a token changed in one theme only says which. Core and MCP: when GitHub's hourly limit runs out without a token, the error says so and how to fix it (set GITHUB_TOKEN for the MCP server) instead of blaming "this token".
