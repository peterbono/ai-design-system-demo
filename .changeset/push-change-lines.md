Claude writes each change line. Draft sessions carry one change line per component change (`DraftItem.lines`, images labeled by line), results may answer `lines: [{ id, line }]` (one sentence, at most 120 characters, no em dash, unknown ids refused; results without lines still work), and `draftChangeLine` gives the deterministic default ("Looks different in Size=sm, State=Default, Variant=primary; no variable explains it"). Requests carry the line (`ComponentChangeRequest.line`, "**What changes:**" in the issue, the brief and Jira). `bridge_pending_drafts` and `bridge_write_drafts` describe and accept lines; the plugin's API-key path asks for and parses them too.

Push hierarchy in the Figma plugin: "Draft with Claude" is a ghost action on the Description (and request Title) label line, one "Drafted by Claude" status line under the field, each component change row reads name and kind, then one sentence, with the table behind "Details" in one font size, no group checkbox for a single item, the bar alone sums up what is sent ("1 request"), and a shorter Components intro.
