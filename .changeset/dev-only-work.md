Studio tells design work from developer work, and says who really made it. Work that only touches code (a title that speaks code such as "React" or "props", tests, examples, types, build or tooling only, component code the visual impact run shows no difference for, a "tech" or "developer" label) no longer shows in Needs you, on the board columns or in the Changes badge: the Overview folds it into one quiet line under the board, "Developer work, 1 in progress", that opens its list. Changes keeps every item and tags developer work "Developer", with an All, Design, Developer filter that shows when a list holds some. When nothing says what a change is, it stays with designers. An exploration card says "Claude is building it" when a real marker says an agent made it (the pull request template box, the Claude Code footer or session link, a "Co-Authored-By: Claude" commit, an agent label, an exploration or request started from the MCP server), and "You are trying it" only for what you started from Studio. The exploration block now records where it was started (`source`: studio, figma, cli or mcp) and the agent behind it (`agent`), and the CLI records `agent: "claude"` when Claude Code runs it.
