Five new components and a supported path for pages without React. `CodeBlock` (code or a command in Plex Mono with a copy button that says "Copied"), `TokenValue` (a token name and value with a color swatch, for before and after values), `Checklist` and `ChecklistRow` (status icon, title, one line of detail and the action on the same row), `ChoiceCardGroup` and `ChoiceCard` (radio choices shown as cards with a title and a description) and `Banner` (a page-level mode banner, Deep Harbor or neutral, optionally sticky). The new `@bridge-ds/react/dom` entry renders Badge, CodeBlock, TokenValue and Checklist as HTML strings with the exact markup and classes of the React components, and adds `tooltipAttributes()` with `bindTooltips()` and `bindCodeBlocks()` for plain-script pages. `bridge audit` counts these renderers as design system components and now flags homemade look-alikes in script-built markup (`class="pill"`, `data-tip` tooltips). Studio and the Library adopt them in place of their homemade pills, tooltips, command rows, value chips, checklist, radio cards and mode banners.
