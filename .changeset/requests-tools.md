Component change requests for developers: MCP tools `bridge_list_requests`, `bridge_get_request` (with a brief to implement the request) and `bridge_create_request`; CLI `bridge request list|show|implement [--claude]|create`; and `bridge request jira-sync` for the optional bridge-jira GitHub Action. Pull request summaries from the core GitHub client now carry the body, so requests link the pull requests that close them.
