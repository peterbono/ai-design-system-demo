One `bridge.config.json` and one schema (`packages/core/bridge.config.schema.json`) for the Figma plugin, the docs site, the CLI and the MCP server: tiers, ordered layers with mode placeholders, modes with parity, contrast, components, docs, changesets and governance (protected branches, branch prefix, labels, guardrails, design and tech owners). The MCP server now runs on `@bridge/core` (layered token sets, minimal-diff edits, contrast, diff, PR body, GitHub client, local git writer) and every surface shares one risk classifier: a token added, changed, renamed or removed is Tier 3 (renames and removals major), a description-only edit is Tier 1 patch.
