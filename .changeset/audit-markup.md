The adoption audit reads Astro, Vue and Svelte files. Template markup counts DS components imported in the frontmatter or `<script>` (Vue kebab case included), native elements a DS component should render (with the DS equivalent), local look-alikes named like a DS component (`Button.astro`), hardcoded values in `style` attributes (`style="..."`, `style={{ ... }}`, Vue `:style`, Svelte `style:prop`), `class` attributes and color attributes, and token references. The frontmatter and `<script>` blocks go through the TS scanner and `<style>` blocks through the CSS audit, with the file's own line numbers. Hidden inputs and elements inside `<noscript>` do not count. New escape hatches, both with a required reason and both kept visible in the report: a `bridge-audit-ignore-next-line: reason` comment on the line above (HTML, JSX, CSS or JS comment; a comment without a reason or above nothing is reported and ignores nothing), and `bridge audit --allowlist file.json` (`allowlist` in `bridge_audit`) for known file:line violations, with stale entries listed. The report gains `files[].ignored`, `files[].ignoreErrors`, `ignored` and the `astro`, `vue` and `svelte` languages (schema updated, still version 1). The docs site's `audit:docs` now sees its raw elements; they sit in a temporary, reasoned allowlist (`apps/docs-site/bridge-audit-allowlist.json`) until the native elements migration removes them.
