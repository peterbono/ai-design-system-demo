# @bridge-ds/core

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 5bfc7e2: The adoption audit reads Astro, Vue and Svelte files. Template markup counts DS components imported in the frontmatter or `<script>` (Vue kebab case included), native elements a DS component should render (with the DS equivalent), local look-alikes named like a DS component (`Button.astro`), hardcoded values in `style` attributes (`style="..."`, `style={{ ... }}`, Vue `:style`, Svelte `style:prop`), `class` attributes and color attributes, and token references. The frontmatter and `<script>` blocks go through the TS scanner and `<style>` blocks through the CSS audit, with the file's own line numbers. Hidden inputs and elements inside `<noscript>` do not count. New escape hatches, both with a required reason and both kept visible in the report: a `bridge-audit-ignore-next-line: reason` comment on the line above (HTML, JSX, CSS or JS comment; a comment without a reason or above nothing is reported and ignores nothing), and `bridge audit --allowlist file.json` (`allowlist` in `bridge_audit`) for known file:line violations, with stale entries listed. The report gains `files[].ignored`, `files[].ignoreErrors`, `ignored` and the `astro`, `vue` and `svelte` languages (schema updated, still version 1). The docs site's `audit:docs` now sees its raw elements; they sit in a temporary, reasoned allowlist (`apps/docs-site/bridge-audit-allowlist.json`) until the native elements migration removes them.
- f1a8b55: Five new components and a supported path for pages without React. `CodeBlock` (code or a command in Plex Mono with a copy button that says "Copied"), `TokenValue` (a token name and value with a color swatch, for before and after values), `Checklist` and `ChecklistRow` (status icon, title, one line of detail and the action on the same row), `ChoiceCardGroup` and `ChoiceCard` (radio choices shown as cards with a title and a description) and `Banner` (a page-level mode banner, Deep Harbor or neutral, optionally sticky). The new `@bridge-ds/react/dom` entry renders Badge, CodeBlock, TokenValue and Checklist as HTML strings with the exact markup and classes of the React components, and adds `tooltipAttributes()` with `bindTooltips()` and `bindCodeBlocks()` for plain-script pages. `bridge audit` counts these renderers as design system components and now flags homemade look-alikes in script-built markup (`class="pill"`, `data-tip` tooltips). Studio and the Library adopt them in place of their homemade pills, tooltips, command rows, value chips, checklist, radio cards and mode banners.

### Patch Changes

- 9494004: Studio cleanup. Changes: the "In review" tab is now "All changes", its status filter is one Select named after the status model (All open, Draft, Ready for review, Approved waiting for code, Shipped, Closed), and the "try together" checkboxes appear only after "Choose changes", so the first screen holds about half the controls. A change detail keeps one ship control: Ship sits on the title line once the change can ship, and the disabled Ship in the action bar is gone, as is "Reply on GitHub". Tokens: on a phone the type chips get their own line and every brand and theme stacks into labeled lines; the draft bar reserves room so it never covers the last rows; a token changed in one theme only says which. Core and MCP: when GitHub's hourly limit runs out without a token, the error says so and how to fix it (set GITHUB_TOKEN for the MCP server) instead of blaming "this token".

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 6fe9f88: Bring in the latest library. A change in Studio now says when the library has moved on since it started ("The library has moved on: 12 updates since this change started."), read from GitHub's compare API, with a "Latest library" row in its checklist. When nothing conflicts, "Bring in the latest library" asks GitHub to update the change, then the page refreshes its checks and visual comparison; the row says beforehand what happens next, from the library's rules (checks run again, approvals need renewing when GitHub dismisses them on new commits). When the change and the library changed the same tokens, the designer resolves them in Bridge: one row per token with the library's value, this change's value and the value before both, "Keep mine" by default or "Use the library's", and no default for a token removed on one side and changed on the other. The contrast checks run on the choices before anything is sent, then Bridge commits the resolved token files on top of the latest library. A conflict in code stays with a developer, with the GitHub link under For developers. The Changes list shows "N updates behind" on each change that is behind. Core gains `planTokenMerge` and `applyTokenMerge`, a file-by-file three-way merge of DTCG token files on the same rules as the Figma sync.
- 11f40fd: Change statuses and reopen. Every change in Studio now has one lifecycle, in designer words and from GitHub data only: Draft, Ready for review, Approved waiting for code, Shipped, Closed. A change waits for code when its design approval is in, nobody asked for changes, it is design work, and every failing check is a developer check; it names the tech owners from the config, or "a developer". The change page opens on one status line (a Badge, one sentence, at most one action): Mark as ready on a draft, Reopen this change on a closed one whose work is still there, or "Start again from this change" when its work was removed (its token edits go to the draft, then Tokens sends them for review). Back to draft sits under More. The Changes list gets a status filter (Open, Draft, Ready for review, Waiting for code, Shipped, Closed; a Select on phones) and one chip per row; the opener never points at a change that waits for code. The Overview "For you" rows carry the same badge, and your own drafts show there. Core adds `GitHubClient.convertToDraft`.
- 4c313d7: Try several changes together. On Studio > Changes (Open), each change has a checkbox; checking 2 to 4 token changes combines them in the browser: the latest library plus each change's own token edits (what it changed since it started, so a change that is behind never undoes newer library values). Nothing is written to GitHub. A token two changes set differently gets one row ("Use Darker default background's" or the other change's), and nothing opens until each has a pick; the contrast checks then run on the combination itself ("All 296 contrast checks pass with these changes together."). A change that edits code is left out and says why on its row ("This one changes code, so it can't be combined here."). "Try 3 changes together" opens the demo admin with `?bridge=101,118,120`: the Bridge toolbar applies the combined tokens live on the production admin (no preview holds all of them, and it says so), "These 3 changes" replaces "This change", its Changes sheet lists the changes with a checkbox each to switch one off live, and Before/After (B) and Show what changed (C) work on what is switched on, the tooltips naming the change a value comes from. "View the library with them" opens Studio Tokens, Components and Quality on `?change=101,118` (the #116 address model, with the picks in `use`): the banner names the changes, changed tokens are marked "Changed in #118", and Quality shows no combined numbers. Core gains `changeEdits`, `combineChanges` and `encodePicks`/`decodePicks` (token-combine), and `previewOverrides`/`cssOf` move to core (css-overrides) so Studio and the admin share them.
- 4bfd417: Studio tells design work from developer work, and says who really made it. Work that only touches code (a title that speaks code such as "React" or "props", tests, examples, types, build or tooling only, component code the visual impact run shows no difference for, a "tech" or "developer" label) no longer shows in Needs you, on the board columns or in the Changes badge: the Overview folds it into one quiet line under the board, "Developer work, 1 in progress", that opens its list. Changes keeps every item and tags developer work "Developer", with an All, Design, Developer filter that shows when a list holds some. When nothing says what a change is, it stays with designers. An exploration card says "Claude is building it" when a real marker says an agent made it (the pull request template box, the Claude Code footer or session link, a "Co-Authored-By: Claude" commit, an agent label, an exploration or request started from the MCP server), and "You are trying it" only for what you started from Studio. The exploration block now records where it was started (`source`: studio, figma, cli or mcp) and the agent behind it (`agent`), and the CLI records `agent: "claude"` when Claude Code runs it.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 80228c0: Claude titles each component request. Change lines in a draft session carry the deterministic request title
  (`DraftLine.title`), and results may answer `lines: [{ id, line, title }]` (`DraftResultLine`; the title is cleaned to
  the title contract by `sanitizeDraftTitle`: one line, sentence case, at most 70 characters, no trailing period, no em
  dash). Older sessions and answers without titles still work. `bridge_pending_drafts` and `bridge_write_drafts` ask for
  the title, the plugin's API-key path asks for and parses it too, and Push uses it for that component's request instead
  of the generic deterministic title ("Add an icon after the label" rather than "Update the look to match Figma").
- adc0df7: Docs drafted with Claude in place, at three levels: the whole page (fill, or rewrite every section), one section, or a
  selected passage (clearer, shorter, or in the Bridge voice). Fill drafts the empty sections and never rewrites written
  ones: when the code is newer than docs.json, written sections are sent as checks, and Claude returns one only when
  something in it is no longer true for the code (the writer's wording kept elsewhere). Results say which checked
  sections are still accurate (`checked`) and which were updated (in `sections`). Same rule for MCP docs items
  (`DocsDraftTask.check`, `DraftResult.checked`).

  Core: new `docs-ai.ts` with the task model (`DocsDraftTask`, `validateDocsTask`), the prompts (`docsTaskPrompt`,
  `docsSelectionPrompt`; `docsPrompt` takes `{ keys, rewrite, outdated }` to ask for only some sections), the answer
  parsing and sanitizing to the docs.json shapes with em dashes removed (`parseDocsReply`, `sanitizeDocsSections`,
  `parseDocsTaskAnswer`, `sanitizeDocsReplacement`), the merges (`applyDocsSections`, and `mergeDocsDraft` for the
  docs-draft Action) and the Messages API request (`anthropicRequest`, `anthropicReplyText`). docs.json gains
  `draftedSections` (the prose sections a partial draft wrote, between `draftedBy` and `needsReview` in
  `formatDocsJson`); `markClaudeDraft(d, sections)` adds to it, `acceptDocsDraft` clears it, `sectionsNeedingReview`
  reads it. The draft exchange takes `docs` items (scope `"docs"`, source `"studio"`) whose results carry `docs` (the
  sections) or `replacement`; `createDocsDraftSession`, `ensureRequestsBranch` and `DraftPoller` move to core.

  MCP: `bridge_pending_drafts` and `bridge_write_drafts` explain docs items and accept `docs` or `replacement` results
  (title and summary are optional now, still required in practice for change items).

  Docs site: `src/scripts/docs-ai.ts` (`draftDocs`, `draftAvailability`, `outdatedSections`, `saveApiKey`,
  `applyDraft`) drafts with the designer's own API key (browser call, key kept in this browser only) or their own
  Claude through the exchange, from `/docs-ai/<slug>.json` (the facts from the code and the repo conventions, built
  with the site). The docs-draft Action now runs the same core code.

- d5bbba9: Exploration install commands that work. On exploration #64 the plugin showed a pkg.pr.new command that returned 404
  (the pkg.pr.new app is not installed); the working one was the prerelease tarball command in the pull request's
  `<!-- bridge-branch-preview -->` comment. Core reads that comment back: `installCommandFromPreviewComment(body)`,
  `readPreviewComment`, `findPreviewComment`, `explorationTryIt` (ready only when the comment's snapshot matches the
  branch head, "building" before, "failed" when the publish failed), `explorationTryItOnGitHub`,
  `explorationShareMessage` and `GitHubClient.listIssueComments`. The draft pull request body no longer guesses a
  command: it points to the comment.

  DS Bridge plugin: the "Sent to <exploration>" screen is for designers. "Try it" lists the previews with the product
  first (the admin demo, by its name in bridge.config.json), then Library and Workbench, one row each with "Open" on the
  same line. "Test build for your product" says whether the build is ready or being prepared (with "Check again"), and
  has one action, "Share with a developer", which copies a ready message with the working command, the previews and the
  pull request. The command itself stays under "Show the command". The bar's primary is "Open in the product" when that
  preview exists, otherwise "Open on GitHub". The Push form drops the "Commit title" disclosure for explorations (the
  title is still generated) and says "Owners review it only if the exploration is promoted."; other Push and Pull
  sentences say "the design system" instead of "main" and drop "commit".

  Studio explorations: the detail reads the install command from the preview comment (or says the test build is being
  prepared); the list no longer shows a guessed pkg.pr.new command.

- 3d3d77d: Library protection: Bridge is the only way into the default branch.

  Core: new `protection.ts` with `protectionRuleset` (the repository ruleset on `~DEFAULT_BRANCH`: no deletion, no
  force push, pull request with at least 1 approval and stale approvals dismissed, required checks, admins may bypass
  in pull request mode only), `protectionState` (protected, partial, unprotected or unknown, with what is missing,
  from rulesets and classic branch protection), `requiredCheckNames` (read from the repository's own CI, without
  Vercel and skipped runs) and `protectionSentence`. `protection-github.ts` adds `loadProtection`,
  `loadRequiredChecks`, `protectLibrary` and `protectRefusal`. The GitHub client gains `listRulesets`, `getRuleset`,
  `createRuleset`, `updateRuleset` and `getBranchProtection` (404 means none, 403 means it cannot be read), and check
  runs carry their app slug.

  CLI: `bridge check` prints whether the library is protected and where to fix it. It never changes the exit code;
  `--offline` (or `BRIDGE_OFFLINE=1`) skips it, and `--json` adds `protection`.

  MCP: the server instructions say every write goes through a branch and a pull request, never straight to the
  default branch.

- 537abd7: Push names structure changes. Each variant keeps a layer outline, so a layer added, removed or moved becomes a
  "Structure change" request (new request kind `structure`) with a line like `New instance layer "Icon" (Icon/Pencil)
after "Label" in primary sm` and the title "Add a layer after Label", instead of a vague visual change. Renames,
  wrappers and hidden layers bound to nothing still send nothing. When an optional part already draws the added layer
  (an icon after the label while "Icon end" exists), the row says "Icon end already does this: show it with the Icon end
  property" and the item starts unchecked; "Keep it as a request" sends it anyway.
- fb40ae8: Claude writes each change line. Draft sessions carry one change line per component change (`DraftItem.lines`, images labeled by line), results may answer `lines: [{ id, line }]` (one sentence, at most 120 characters, no em dash, unknown ids refused; results without lines still work), and `draftChangeLine` gives the deterministic default ("Looks different in Size=sm, State=Default, Variant=primary; no variable explains it"). Requests carry the line (`ComponentChangeRequest.line`, "**What changes:**" in the issue, the brief and Jira). `bridge_pending_drafts` and `bridge_write_drafts` describe and accept lines; the plugin's API-key path asks for and parses them too.

  Push hierarchy in the Figma plugin: "Draft with Claude" is a ghost action on the Description (and request Title) label line, one "Drafted by Claude" status line under the field, each component change row reads name and kind, then one sentence, with the table behind "Details" in one font size, no group checkbox for a single item, the bar alone sums up what is sent ("1 request"), and a shorter Components intro.

- 196d02b: Real branch preview URLs and install commands everywhere, never guessed ones. On exploration #64
  (`explore/button-normal-again`) Vercel shortened the admin and Storybook aliases with a hash
  (`bridge-admin-git-explore-button-norm-0ed5ba-peterbonos-projects.vercel.app`), so the template URLs were wrong.

  Core: `branchPreviewUrls(client, prNumber | sha, config)` reads what Vercel reports, in order: GitHub deployments of the
  head commit, the Vercel commit statuses (state of each deploy), the Vercel bot comment (`[vc]` header, decoded), and the
  `previews.apps` template only when its host label fits in 63 characters. Pure parts: `parseVercelComment`,
  `findVercelComment`, `appForProject` (Vercel project to app by the template host), `resolveBranchPreviews`,
  `previewLinksOf`, `previewsSettled`. `explorationTestBuildOnGitHub` returns the install command from the preview comment
  and the real previews in one read. `GitHubClient.listCommitStatuses` and `listDeployments`. The sticky PR comment
  (`previewComment`) takes the resolved previews and never prints a shortened template URL. Removed: `explorationInstall`
  and `ExplorationInstall` (guessed pkg.pr.new commands); `StartedExploration.install` becomes `tryIt` and
  `ExplorationSummary.install` is gone (it gains `headSha`).

  Preview packages workflow: the comment's preview table uses the URLs Vercel reports (deployments, statuses, its comment).

  MCP and CLI: `bridge_list_explorations` / `bridge explore list` return the install command from the preview comment
  (`install.state` building, ready or failed) and the previews Vercel reports; `bridge explore start` no longer prints a
  pkg.pr.new command.

  Studio: the pull request detail ("Preview and install") shows the URLs Vercel reports and the command the workflow
  published, or that the test build is being prepared; the exploration detail fills its previews the same way.

  DS Bridge plugin: the exploration result screen ("Try it") shows the real URLs, checks every 15 seconds for up to 10
  minutes while it is open (stopping once the command and every preview are ready), updates in place without
  re-rendering, and keeps "Check again".

- fe29bed: Studio requests nobody is on now end in a decision, not a dead end. The Overview row says "Open request" (no more
  "Triage") and what is expected: "Nobody is on it yet: explore it, assign someone or decline it." On the request, a
  design system owner who is connected gets one row: Start an exploration (opens the Explorations form filled from the
  request, then links the request to it and puts them on it), Assign someone (a DS Combobox of the people who can edit
  the repository, in place) and Decline (a DS Dialog that asks for a reason, says who reads it, posts it and closes the
  request as not planned). Once someone is on it, the row gives way to one sentence ("@ana is on it", "@ana is exploring
  it"); everyone else reads who decides. A request linked to an exploration now counts its draft as the work on it.

  Core: `linkRequestToExplorationOnGitHub`, `assignRequestOnGitHub`, `declineRequestOnGitHub`, the pure
  `withRequestExploration`, `declineComment` and `declineReasonProblems`, `GitHubClient.updateIssue`, `addAssignees` and
  `listCollaborators`, and `requests` in the exploration settings (listed in its draft pull request body).

- dd2261c: Roles with default rights, editable per team, and a visual before and after that can run on demand.

  Core: `governance.rights` in `bridge.config.json` says which owner group may approve design, approve tech and ship
  (merge, which publishes to the products): `{ "approveDesign": ["design"], "approveTech": ["tech"], "ship": ["tech"] }`
  by default, and a team may let design owners ship too (`"ship": ["design", "tech"]`). A config without `rights`
  behaves as before: approvals follow `owners`, anyone with write access ships. New top-level `visualImpact.mode`,
  `"auto"` (default) or `"on-demand"`. Both are validated by `loadConfig` and the JSON schema and written back by
  `toConfigJson`. New exports in `rights.ts`: `DEFAULT_RIGHTS`, `normalizeRights`, `holdersOf`, `approverLists`,
  `shipPolicy`, `canShip`, `whoCanShipSentence`, `groupsPhrase`, `RIGHT_LABEL`, `VISUAL_CHECK_LABEL`.

  MCP and CLI: `bridge init` (detected configs) starts from the default rights.

  Studio: Settings gains Roles: one sentence, who holds each right with their avatars, and the visual before and after
  mode; "Change roles" proposes the edit as a pull request on `bridge.config.json` (only `governance.rights` and
  `visualImpact` change). Reviews counts approvals against the rights and keeps Merge off for a viewer without the
  ship right, saying who can ("Only the tech owner can ship this (@theo)."); the owner override never bypasses it.
  In on-demand mode a pull request without a before and after offers "Show the visual impact", which adds the
  `visual-check` label (the workflow runs on it), or links to GitHub without a write token.

- 1e78f3b: Roles by team: `governance.owners` may name GitHub teams (`"@acme/design"`) as well as people, so a company assigns
  roles by team and manages membership in GitHub. Still no database.

  Core: new `teams.ts`. `parseOwnerEntry` reads a person (`"theo"`, `"@theo"`) or a team (`"@org/team-slug"`);
  `loadConfig` and the JSON schema reject anything else with the entry named and both forms spelled out.
  `TeamDirectory` expands teams to logins through any client with the new `GitHubClient` methods
  (`listTeamMembers`, paginated; `getTeamMembership` for one person; `getAccountType`; `listOrgTeams`), cached for five
  minutes. A team it cannot read is a typed state (`no-token`, `missing-permission`, `not-found`, `personal-account`,
  `unreachable`) with the fix in `teamUnreadableMessage`, never an empty list: it keeps its place in the expanded lists
  and matches nobody. `approverLists` and `shipPolicy` take the team states; `whoCanShipSentence` names a team with its
  size ("Only the tech owner can ship this (@acme/web (4 people)).").

  CLI: `bridge check` lists the teams named as owners with their size and reports each team it cannot read, with the
  fix (never part of the exit code). MCP: `bridge_get_review` returns `roles`: who may approve design, approve tech and
  ship, with teams named, and an approval counts when the reviewer is in the team.

  Studio: approvals, who acts, the ship gate (with a membership check for the viewer), the Overview and History
  count team members and name teams as teams. Settings, Review rules gains Design owners and Tech owners rows: a team
  is a chip with its member count and avatars, a team that cannot be read gets one sentence with the reason and the
  fix, and Edit takes a person or a team (a DS Combobox suggesting the organization's teams and the repository's
  people), sent for review on `bridge.config.json`.

- 7cb1733: Say clearly when the GitHub token stopped working (revoked, regenerated or expired), instead of scattered errors.

  Core: `GitHubError` gains `auth` (`'rejected'` for a 401, `'missing-permission'` for a 403 "Resource not accessible
  by personal access token" or a permission GitHub names in `X-Accepted-GitHub-Permissions`) and `permission`
  (`issues`, `pull_requests`, `contents`...: from the header, else from the endpoint). Rate limits stay rate limits.
  New exports: `classifyAuth`, `requiredPermission`, `isTokenRejected`, `isMissingPermission`,
  `missingPermissionMessage`, `permissionLabel`, `TOKEN_REJECTED_MESSAGE`, `TOKEN_SETTINGS_URL`. A refused token now
  stops an exploration promotion instead of becoming a warning.

  Studio: one session state. Any 401 marks the saved token as stopped working (it is kept, not deleted): the sidebar
  account block shows "Your GitHub token stopped working" with Reconnect (the connect dialog, field focused, saving
  replaces the token), Settings says the same, write actions show that one message, and reads fall back to anonymous.
  A missing permission is named on the action that needs it ("This token cannot create issues. Add Issues: Read and
  write on GitHub.") with a link to the token settings. The token is checked once on load when the last check is older
  than an hour (GET /user, cached with its result).

  DS Bridge plugin: the Settings token row shows "Stopped working" with "Replace token" after a 401; Pull, Push and the
  other GitHub flows show one callout, "Your GitHub token stopped working. Replace it in Settings.", with a button that
  goes there. Access is checked once when the plugin starts. A missing permission is named, with the GitHub link.

### Patch Changes

- a6914d7: Studio Tokens and Components, designer first.

  Tokens: the list says "Semantic and foundation tokens" (the base collection reads Foundation in Studio), collections
  and usage filters move under Advanced in Options, swatches are 24px and values read at the UI size, and long names
  wrap at their dots instead of truncating next to the details panel. The details say "Where the value comes from".
  The value popover shows the real components that use the token, light and dark, repainted on every pick. The review
  opens on its visual preview: light and dark side by side, before above after, several components scaled to fill
  their frames; Export JSON moves under "For developers". "Send for review" replaces "Propose change": the dialog says
  who approves from the configured rights ("The design owner and a developer will approve it; nothing ships before
  both."), drafts the title from the edit ("Darker primary action fill") and keeps the branch sentence under "For
  developers".

  Components: each row starts with a thumbnail of the real component, "Stories" reads "Examples", and two columns join:
  open requests per component and "Used in products" (from the committed audit reports). The drawer opens on the
  component live in light and dark; Code, Workbench, props and stories move under "For developers". A request carries
  a Figma link and one image (pasted or picked, committed to the requests branch like the Figma plugin does), Kind
  starts on Visual change, and the button reads "Send request".

  Core: the request kind "Prop change" reads "Option change (prop)" everywhere requests are shown.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e31bac2: bridge audit counts every visible UI instance: router links outside a DS component's `render` prop (react-router,
  ra-core `LinkBase`, next/link), anchors with `href`, images and chart libraries (recharts, Nivo, Chart.js...,
  foreign with no DS equivalent). Providers and other non-visual parts no longer count as DS instances.
- e54d2a1: Packages are publishable under the `@bridge-ds` npm scope (renamed from `@demo-ds` and `@bridge`). Each ships built ES modules, type declarations and, for React, one `styles.css`; the monorepo keeps resolving TypeScript sources through the `source` export condition. `@bridge-ds/core` adds branch preview helpers (`previewUrl`, `snapshotUrl`, `previewComment`) and a `previews` section in `bridge.config.json`. `@bridge-ds/react` adds an opt-in staging token override: `ThemeProvider` `tokenOverride` loads an allowlisted `tokens.css` from `?bridge-tokens=`, off by default and refused in production builds unless enabled.
- bac1cb2: Measure design system adoption in product code. `@bridge-ds/core/audit` finds hardcoded colors, lengths, radii, shadows, durations, z-index and fonts in CSS, SCSS, style/sx/styled/theme objects, CSS-in-JS and Tailwind classes, suggests the closest token (deltaE in OKLab across every mode, nearest scale step), and counts DS components against foreign UI libraries, native elements and re-created components. `bridge audit <path>` reports token and component adoption as JSON (versioned schema) and Markdown, compares with a baseline, fails CI under a threshold, and `--fix --write` replaces exact CSS matches with `var(--token)`. The MCP server adds `bridge_audit` and the `migrate-file-to-ds` prompt. New `@bridge-ds/stylelint-plugin` (`bridge/use-tokens`) and `@bridge-ds/eslint-plugin` (`no-hardcoded-style-values`, `prefer-ds-components`).
- One `bridge.config.json` and one schema (`packages/core/bridge.config.schema.json`) for the Figma plugin, the docs site, the CLI and the MCP server: tiers, ordered layers with mode placeholders, modes with parity, contrast, components, docs, changesets and governance (protected branches, branch prefix, labels, guardrails, design and tech owners). The MCP server now runs on `@bridge-ds/core` (layered token sets, minimal-diff edits, contrast, diff, PR body, GitHub client, local git writer) and every surface shares one risk classifier: a token added, changed, renamed or removed is Tier 3 (renames and removals major), a description-only edit is Tier 1 patch.
- f103729: Owner override for solo maintainers and small teams. `governance.override` in `bridge.config.json` (`allowed`, `requireReason`, `minReasonLength`; absent by default) lets listed logins merge from Reviews when the only thing missing is approvals. It is never offered while CI fails or runs, when changes are requested, or on a draft. Bridge checks the token has write access, asks for a reason in a confirmation dialog, posts a `**Bridge owner override**` comment with the login, reason and missing approvals, then merges with the method the repo allows. If GitHub refuses, its message is shown and the comment is marked not merged.
- cd5565e: Visual impact analysis for design system changes. `@bridge-ds/core` gains a usage index (CSS variables each component reads, components it renders). New `@bridge-ds/visual` builds Storybook and the admin app at two refs, screenshots the impacted stories (every brand and theme) and the admin screens (every tenant and theme) deterministically, and pixel-diffs them into before, after, diff and composite images plus a JSON manifest. `bridge impact` and the `bridge_visual_impact` MCP tool run it; a workflow posts the result on pull requests.
- 95db484: Change drafts: `draftRequestText(component, kind, changes)` and `draftPushDescription(entries, components)` write a sentence-case title and a 1 or 2 sentence summary from detected changes only (no reason, no invented number, no em dash), with `pushChangeRows` for a change table of variable edits and `cleanDraftText` to strip em dashes.
- cf3f5bb: Component specs: `ComponentSpec` types and helpers in the main entry, and a generator in `@bridge-ds/core/node` (`generateRepoComponentSpecs`) that derives variant axes, properties, parts and per-variant token bindings from a component's TSX and CSS modules, with a small CSS cascade. New optional `components.specs` config key (default `packages/react/component-specs.json`).
- abe4395: Draft exchange (`draft-exchange.ts`): the pending drafts file the Figma plugin and the MCP server share on the `bridge-requests` branch (`.bridge/drafts/<sessionId>.json`), with compose, parse, validate, sanitize (no em dash, title at most 70 characters, summary at most 3 sentences) and merge helpers, the Bridge voice rules and output contract, and GitHub helpers that read and write sessions with the file sha and retry on 409. `GitHubClient` gains `getFile` (text and sha), `getFileBase64`, `listDirectory` and `deleteFile`.
- 7261f47: Component specs describe swappable parts: `swap` on icon parts (default icon from the docs preview or the AllStates
  story) and on full-bleed compound content (Card body: text or media slot), `slots` per variant, and file-level
  `icons` (normalized Lucide SVGs read from `lucide-react`), `iconStyle` and `slots` sections.
- a6a3a46: Add `tokenUsage()`: one definition of a token in use. A token is in use when a component stylesheet or a global
  stylesheet (base styles, app shell) reads its variable, or when a token in use aliases it. Bridge uses it for the
  Overview counts and the token explorer's Unused flag.
- d5d263b: Docs drafts. `@bridge-ds/core` computes what code can tell about a component's docs (props table, tokens, anatomy from the CSS module classes, contrast notes, a changelog line) and keeps the review state of AI-drafted prose (`draftedBy`, `needsReview`). The MCP server adds `bridge_draft_docs`, which returns that pre-fill and a prompt for your own Claude to write the prose; the CLI adds `bridge docs draft <Component>` (`--json` for CI).
- 525217f: Explorations: `explorations.ts` (branch naming `explore/<slug>`, the `exploration` label, the draft pull request body with purpose, snapshot install command, previews and promote or close, status running, promoted or closed, and the promotion plan with tier labels from the shared classifier) and `explorations-github.ts` (start, list, promote, close). `GitHubClient` gains `withBranchPrefix`, `commitToBranch` and `markReadyForReview` (GraphQL `markPullRequestReadyForReview`, since REST cannot unset draft). Component change requests take an optional `exploration` branch: the issue gets the `exploration` label and the brief says to work on that branch, never in a pull request to main. The branch preview comment says "Try this exploration in your product" for explorations and installs them as `name@url`.
- 5c40693: New brands, from every surface. `planNewBrand` in `@bridge-ds/core` builds a brand file (primary and neutral ramps from the shared ramp engine, the starting brand's radius, fonts and theme overrides), adds the slug to `modes.brand` in `bridge.config.json`, and runs the contrast gate for the new brand in light and dark. The CLI gets `bridge brand create` and `bridge brand list`, the MCP server `bridge_list_brands`, `bridge_plan_brand` and `bridge_propose_brand`, the Figma plugin offers a new Brand mode as a new brand on Push, and the Studio has a four-step New brand flow with a live preview. The token build reads its brands from `bridge.config.json`, and `scripts/ramps.mjs` runs the same ramp engine (primitives unchanged).
- 019a220: Pulled components: Badge md gets its padding and min height (a `calc()` of tokens is resolved and set, reported as "set,
  not bound"; a `calc()` of one token is bound). Card is drawn at the `size.80` width, its header, body and footer fill it,
  body text wraps instead of collapsing to 0px, and it clips its content so the footer stays inside the rounded corners.
  Tag loses its extra "label" wrapper frame (a re-pull moves the layers and removes it). Variant grids keep the same gap
  between rows and columns of different sizes. Specs gain `clip` and `fill` on parts and calc() expressions of token paths.
- a0142d2: Branch previews: `previews.production` in `bridge.config.json` holds the production URL of each app (docs, Storybook,
  admin demo), and `appUrl()` picks the branch preview on a feature branch and the production URL on the default branch
  or in a local build. The docs site links its Storybook through it.
- 36cb504: Component change requests: `composeRequestIssue`, `parseRequestIssue`, `requestStatus`, `requestBrief`, Jira field mapping, GitHub issue methods, and an `integrations` block in bridge.config.json.

### Patch Changes

- 5b9d677: `bridge audit` no longer counts a native element passed as a component's render element (`<Button render={<a href="/tokens" />}>`) as a separate native UI instance, as it already did for router links: the DS component is the UI.
- 3e59115: `bridge audit` and `bridge/use-tokens` no longer report a ring built only from tokens (`inset 0 0 0 var(--border-width-default) var(--color-border-default)`) as a hardcoded shadow: bare zero offsets carry no value. Stylelint already allowed this form.
- a55525d: Bridge brand moves to the "Field Guide" direction: white content, ink text, Harbor zones and Deep Harbor as the one strong color, Fraunces headings over Instrument Sans text, rounder radii. See `docs/DESIGN-LANGUAGE.md` (v2).

  Why this is major for `@bridge-ds/tokens`: the default brand changes what existing tokens resolve to, and consumers must check their screens.

  - Palette roles re-pointed in the bridge brand: `palette.neutral` from steel to the new `color.ink` ramp; `palette.primary`, `palette.accent` and `palette.link` to the new `color.harbor` ramp; `palette.info` from cable to plum. Orange is now only the categorical chart hue (`palette.categorical`).
  - `color.bg.default` is white (`palette.neutral.0`) in bridge light. Ocean keeps its tinted canvas, links and zone through `brands/ocean.light.tokens.json`.
  - Primary action and checked controls move to `primary.700` (hover 800, active 900); links to `link.700` (hover 800); `color.signal.default` to `accent.600`; `focus.ring.color` to `accent.700`. Dark: actions and checked controls use `primary.300/200/100` with `primary.950` text.
  - `font.family.sans` is Instrument Sans in bridge (was IBM Plex Sans).
  - Radius roles in bridge: inset 6, control 12, container 20, overlay 20 (were 2, 6, 10, 14). Primitive `radius.xl` is 12 (was 14).
  - Primitive `font.size` steps changed: `300` 17 to 16, `400` 20 to 21, `600` 29 to 30, `700` 35 to 36, `800` 42 to 44, `1000` 60 to 64.
  - `control.height.md` is 44 in comfortable density (was 40) and 36 in compact (was 32).

  Additions: `color.bg.zone` (Harbor blocks, light `primary.200`, dark `primary.900`, ocean light `primary.50`), `font.family.display` (Fraunces in bridge, Plex Sans in ocean), `font.family.fraunces`, `font.family.instrument-sans`, `typography.<display|h1|h2|h3|body|ui|caption>.{size,line-height,weight,family,tracking}` in both brands, `font.leading.{16,20,26,28,32,38,50,68}`, `size.11` (44px), and the `color.ink.*` and `color.harbor.*` ramps with pinned brand anchors (ink 200 `#E3E8EE`, 600 `#5B6672`, 900 `#15202B`; harbor 200 `#CFE8FF`, 700 `#0B4A8B`). `contrast.checks.json` gains 5 pairs on `color.bg.zone` (296 checks, 0 failing). Fixes a missing `$type` on `color.bg.zone` in the semantic light and dark files.

  `@bridge-ds/react`: no API change, but every component's rendered look changes through the tokens (colors, fonts, radii, 44px default controls). PageHeader, Card, Dialog and Drawer titles read the new `typography.*` roles; medium Badges set at 14/20 (the `ui` role), small Badges stay 12/16.

  `@bridge-ds/docs-site`: the Bridge site wears the Field Guide brand. Top bar of five items, a short side nav (no headings, no counts, collapsible groups), Harbor header blocks on Library section pages, new Library home and Studio overview, version chip by the page title, branch picker by the Studio title, brand and density in the preview toolbars. The theme playground is removed; `/playground/` redirects to the Library home. `.stylelintrc.json` accepts `var(--typography-<role>-family)` for `font-family`.

  `@bridge-ds/core`, `@bridge-ds/cli`, `@bridge-ds/mcp`, `@bridge-ds/eslint-plugin`, `@bridge-ds/stylelint-plugin`, `@bridge-ds/figma-plugin`: test expectations and fixtures follow the new token values (ink chains, white canvas, the ocean overrides, 296 contrast checks). No behavior change.

- c66908c: `patchDocsJson` writes edited docs.json as a minimal diff of the file it replaces, and `acceptDocsText` now changes only the needsReview line.
- 2c79d5d: Component change requests for developers: MCP tools `bridge_list_requests`, `bridge_get_request` (with a brief to implement the request) and `bridge_create_request`; CLI `bridge request list|show|implement [--claude]|create`; and `bridge request jira-sync` for the optional bridge-jira GitHub Action. Pull request summaries from the core GitHub client now carry the body, so requests link the pull requests that close them.
