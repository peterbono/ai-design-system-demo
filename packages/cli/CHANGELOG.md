## 0.11.2

### Patch Changes

- 5ec4a47: One status per branch, everywhere. `reviewStatusKind` is the single derivation for the Branches list, the branch page, the home cards, `bridge_what_needs_me`, `bridge_branch_status` and `bridge branch status`. A repo with no automated checks is a calm state of its own ("No automated checks", `CI_STATE_LABEL`) and the status comes from the approvals, as for any branch. While GitHub computes whether a branch merges cleanly, a missing approval still shows; "Checking for conflicts" only holds back "Ready to merge". The words live in core (`REVIEW_STATUS_LABEL`), and the branch page header now shows the same pill as its row ("Owner override needed", "Design owner to approve") instead of a plain "In review".
- 5ec4a47: Suggestions, visual checks and titles. A suggestion whose change no longer applies to main (main moved and the value it changes is not the one it was suggested from) reads Outdated in Studio, `bridge_list_suggestions` and `bridge_get_suggestion`, through one core rule (`suggestionStalenessOnGitHub`, over `planSuggestionApply`). An applied and closed suggestion keeps only its final label ("suggestion: applied"; "suggestion: declined" when declined): `bridge_apply_suggestion`, `bridge_link_suggestion`, `bridge apply` and a merge from Bridge (`markSuggestionsAppliedOnGitHub`) remove "needs review" and "applying". The visual-check label and "the visual comparison runs again" are offered only when the repo has the visual impact workflow (`hasVisualWorkflow`, `visualOffer`); otherwise the branch page shows a quiet "Set up visual checks" link. Request and suggestion titles are never prefixed twice ("Select: select: ...") and keep component names as written ("EmptyState"), through `subjectTitle`.

### Patch Changes

- c4d666e: The CLI reports its own version: `bridge --version`, the help banner, audit reports and snapshots recorded the `@bridge-ds/mcp` version (0.8.3) instead. `bridge --version` also printed the help and exited 2; it now prints the version and exits 0, like `bridge version`.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 9b0b653: Hosted Library per team (multi-team PR 4a). `/library/<owner>/<repo>/` serves a team's published design system:
  Home, Foundations (generic token specimens), Components (cards by family; one component with a live Storybook story
  and its `docs.json` guidance) and Tokens (every token with its value per theme). Each page is built once at
  `/library-shell/...` and reached through two new `vercel.json` rewrites; the build fails on a missing shell or on any
  file that would take a team's Library address. Signed out, a Library reads the team's `bridge-data` snapshot from the
  raw host with no GitHub API call; signed in, it reads like Studio. Pages are `noindex` unless `bridge.config.json` sets
  the new `library.public: true` (core `libraryIsPublic`, schema). `bridge snapshot` now also writes `llms.txt` (core
  `snapshotLlmsTxt`), which the Library links for AI agents. On a team's Studio, the header's Library button opens the
  team's Library. `scripts/hosted-smoke.mjs` covers the Library routes.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 1a560aa: New `bridge snapshot`: writes the repo model of a checkout for hosted Bridge (`snapshot.json`: the token, contrast and
  component files the model reads, Figma coverage without the 1 MB specs, contrast results, counts) plus
  `audits/<id>.json` (`--audit <folder>[=label]` runs `bridge audit`, `--audit-report` carries existing reports). Core
  gets the snapshot schema: `parseSnapshot`, `buildSnapshot`, `snapshotSource` (a `RepoSource`, so `loadRepoModel`
  reads a snapshot like a repository), `recordingSource`, `snapshotIsFresh`. The `bridge-data` workflow publishes it
  to the orphan `bridge-data` branch; `templates/bridge-data.yml` is the copy for other teams (docs/HOSTED.md).

### Minor Changes

- b6f1e68: Opt-in `governance.soloOwnerCanApproveBoth` for a design system run by one person. When it is true and the owners
  resolve to exactly one person holding both roles, that person's approval counts as the design and the tech approval,
  so Tier 2 and Tier 3 pull requests and suggestions can reach approved. Default false: one person still never covers
  both approvals alone. The author of a change still never approves it. Core adds `soloApprover`, `soloOwnerOf`,
  `soloOwnerSentence` and an optional rules argument to `summarizeApprovals`; `summarizeSuggestionApprovals` reads the
  flag from its governance. Studio Settings shows an "Only owner" line when the rule is active, the suggestion and pull
  request reviews say "As the only owner, your approval covers design and code." with one Approve, and
  `bridge settings`, `bridge branch status`, `bridge suggestions show` and the MCP tools say the same.

### Minor Changes

- d193898: Suggestions from Claude and the terminal. How a change reaches the code now follows `"changes"` in `bridge.config.json`: with `"suggest"` (the default when the key is absent) the writing tools file a suggestion, a GitHub issue with the exact change that the owners approve and a developer applies, instead of a branch and a pull request; `"direct"` keeps branches and pull requests. `bridge_propose_token_change`, `bridge_save_docs`, `bridge_propose_brand`, `bridge_propose_revert`, `bridge_open_library_branch` and `bridge_push_figma_component` take `changes` (`"suggest"` or `"direct"`) for one call and return `status: "suggested"` with the issue number in suggest mode; the CLI commands take `--suggest` or `--direct` (`bridge propose`, `bridge brand create`, `bridge revert`, `bridge docs save`, `bridge pieces open`, `bridge figma push`). Writing to an exploration or a branch in review (`branch`, `pr`) is unchanged. `bridge_get_config` says which mode the repo uses.

  New MCP tools (67 in all): `bridge_list_suggestions`, `bridge_get_suggestion` (the change, its checks, its version and the approvals still missing), `bridge_create_suggestion` (any payload, paths checked first), `bridge_review_suggestion` (approve, request changes, comment or decline; counts only for owners read from the default branch, on the version reviewed), `bridge_apply_suggestion` ("Apply Bridge suggestion #42": dry run, a new local branch, the working tree or a patch on a local checkout, the files to write on a remote repo; records on the issue that it is being applied) and `bridge_link_suggestion` (the pull request that applies it). New CLI commands: `bridge suggestions [list | show <n> | link <n> --pr <m>]`, `bridge apply <n> [--write | --patch] [--dry-run] [--accept-edited] [--force-unapproved]` (exit 0 applied or already applied, 1 not approved, blocked or refused, 2 usage, 3 conflict) and `bridge review <n> --approve | --request-changes | --decline`. The token hints say what each mode needs: Issues read and write for suggestions and requests, Contents and Pull requests for direct changes.

### Minor Changes

- 22e53c7: Components changed in Figma go back to the library as library branches. The DS Bridge plugin's Push tab reads the diff Pull reads in "Review updates" the other way round and routes each changed component (`planComponentPush`): a token swap on a component token that paints only the changed variants becomes an exact token change, no AI (the shared `planTokenProposal` and `writeTokenProposalOnGitHub`, with the contrast gate run again on the component tokens that alias a checked pair, `componentContrastPairs`, and the other components that share the token named); a new variant, property, layer, swapped instance or component, or a swap a token alone cannot say, opens a draft branch carrying the spec (`.bridge/figma/<name>.json`: variant matrix, properties, bound variables and layers per variant, screenshot) labelled `waiting-for-claude` until Claude AI writes the code there and it becomes `drafted-by-claude`; detached layers, values set by hand, styles and variables the library lacks are listed under "Fix in Figma first" with what to do, never sent. Every branch starts with "From Figma" (`parseFigmaOrigin`) and carries `from-figma`. The set remembers its branch: once it ships or closes, the next Pull rebuilds the set from the reviewed code, so Figma never diverges. MCP: `bridge_figma_changes`, `bridge_get_figma_change`, `bridge_mark_figma_change_drafted`, `bridge_push_figma_component` (61 tools). CLI: `bridge figma`, `bridge figma show <n> [--draft]`, `bridge figma drafted <n>`, `bridge figma push <diff.json>`.

### Minor Changes

- 5b93962: Product branches bring what they invent back to the library. `missingPieces` (in `@bridge-ds/core/audit`) runs the adoption audit on each product file a product branch changes, at its start and at its head, and keeps what the branch added that the library lacks: a value written on a library component becomes a variant of it ("Badge: overdue tone"), a component from another UI library with no equivalent becomes a new component, any other hardcoded value becomes a token beside the closest one. Values equal to a token and components the library has are fixes, not pieces. `openLibraryBranchOnGitHub` opens the library side of a piece and links both ways: a token change (through the new shared `planTokenProposal` and `writeTokenProposalOnGitHub`, which `bridge_propose_token_change` now uses too), a library exploration for a variant, or a component request for a new component; the library side says "Needed by" the product branch (label `needed-by-product`), the product branch records the link in its description. The product branch takes the library branch's preview (Bridge merges it in, `GitHubClient.mergeIntoBranch`), and `switchToPublishedOnGitHub` brings main in once the library ships. MCP: `bridge_missing_pieces`, `bridge_open_library_branch`, `bridge_product_branch`, `bridge_use_library_preview`, `bridge_switch_to_published` (57 tools). CLI: `bridge pieces <n> [--record]`, `bridge pieces status|open|preview|switch`.

### Minor Changes

- 51e743c: Studio parity: every action a designer takes in Bridge Studio now works with Claude (MCP) and in the terminal.

  - MCP: 20 new tools for branches in review (what needs me, status, send for review, back to draft, review, ask someone else to review,
    comment and reply, merge through Studio's gate with the owner override, close, reopen, update from main with
    token conflicts, try it in a product and share it, try 2 to 4 branches together), docs saved for review,
    explorations promoted or closed, products, settings and Figma coverage. `bridge_propose_token_change` takes
    `pr` (add edits to a branch in review), `jira` and `product`; explorations and requests take `product`.
  - CLI: `bridge branch ...`, `bridge products`, `bridge settings`, `bridge coverage`, `bridge docs save`, and
    `--product`, `--jira`, `--pr` where work starts.
  - Core: the review and merge rules, the branch writes, update from main, sharing, try in product, try together,
    docs proposals and Jira keys moved from the docs site into `@bridge-ds/core`, so Studio, the MCP server and
    the CLI run one implementation. New `products` list in `bridge.config.json` (schema included), defaulting to
    Admin demo and Library; Studio's Branches page groups by it with the same result.

### Minor Changes

- 6b07b05: Check fidelity: the Pull tab compares every generated Figma variant with the same variant rendered from code and says, per component, "Matches the code" or "Differs from the code: 12% of pixels, size 120x40 vs 118x40", with Figma, code and differences side by side. Nothing in the file changes. Core adds the pure comparison (`compareImages`, tolerant of font rasterization and antialiasing), the storable `FidelityReport` and the variant to code mapping (`planReference`); `bridge figma-references` (visual) captures the code images from Storybook, published on main by the Figma references workflow to the `bridge-visual` branch. React adds a hidden Storybook fixture, "Internal/Figma reference", not part of the package.

### Patch Changes

- 5bfc7e2: The adoption audit reads Astro, Vue and Svelte files. Template markup counts DS components imported in the frontmatter or `<script>` (Vue kebab case included), native elements a DS component should render (with the DS equivalent), local look-alikes named like a DS component (`Button.astro`), hardcoded values in `style` attributes (`style="..."`, `style={{ ... }}`, Vue `:style`, Svelte `style:prop`), `class` attributes and color attributes, and token references. The frontmatter and `<script>` blocks go through the TS scanner and `<style>` blocks through the CSS audit, with the file's own line numbers. Hidden inputs and elements inside `<noscript>` do not count. New escape hatches, both with a required reason and both kept visible in the report: a `bridge-audit-ignore-next-line: reason` comment on the line above (HTML, JSX, CSS or JS comment; a comment without a reason or above nothing is reported and ignores nothing), and `bridge audit --allowlist file.json` (`allowlist` in `bridge_audit`) for known file:line violations, with stale entries listed. The report gains `files[].ignored`, `files[].ignoreErrors`, `ignored` and the `astro`, `vue` and `svelte` languages (schema updated, still version 1). The docs site's `audit:docs` now sees its raw elements; they sit in a temporary, reasoned allowlist (`apps/docs-site/bridge-audit-allowlist.json`) until the native elements migration removes them.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 4bfd417: Studio tells design work from developer work, and says who really made it. Work that only touches code (a title that speaks code such as "React" or "props", tests, examples, types, build or tooling only, component code the visual impact run shows no difference for, a "tech" or "developer" label) no longer shows in Needs you, on the board columns or in the Changes badge: the Overview folds it into one quiet line under the board, "Developer work, 1 in progress", that opens its list. Changes keeps every item and tags developer work "Developer", with an All, Design, Developer filter that shows when a list holds some. When nothing says what a change is, it stays with designers. An exploration card says "Claude is building it" when a real marker says an agent made it (the pull request template box, the Claude Code footer or session link, a "Co-Authored-By: Claude" commit, an agent label, an exploration or request started from the MCP server), and "You are trying it" only for what you started from Studio. The exploration block now records where it was started (`source`: studio, figma, cli or mcp) and the agent behind it (`agent`), and the CLI records `agent: "claude"` when Claude Code runs it.
- c499852: The docs now treat npm as the main install path. The Install page leads with `npm install @bridge-ds/react @bridge-ds/tokens` and `npx @bridge-ds/cli check`, lists every package with a link to its npmjs.com page and the version read from its package.json, and keeps the clone install in a "For contributors" disclosure at the bottom. The Agents page connects Claude to a GitHub repository with `npx -y @bridge-ds/mcp --repo owner/name` first (read-only, a token to open pull requests), with a local folder as the alternative. README, docs/AI.md and the package READMEs no longer say the packages are unpublished. `bridge init` now writes `npx -y @bridge-ds/mcp` into `.mcp.json` and the Claude Desktop snippet outside the Bridge repo (it wrote a path into the npx cache), and `bridge --help` exits 0.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 3d3d77d: Library protection: Bridge is the only way into the default branch.

  Core: new `protection.ts` with `protectionRuleset` (the repository ruleset on `~DEFAULT_BRANCH`: no deletion, no
  force push, pull request with at least 1 approval and stale approvals dismissed, required checks, admins may bypass
  in pull request mode only), `protectionState` (protected, partial, unprotected or unknown, with what is missing,
  from rulesets and classic branch protection), `requiredCheckNames` (read from the repository's own CI, without
  Vercel and skipped runs) and `protectionSentence`. `protection-github.ts` adds `loadProtection`,
  `loadRequiredChecks`, `protectLibrary` and `protectRefusal`. The GitHub client gains `listRulesets`, `getRuleset`,
  `createRuleset`, `updateRuleset` and `getBranchProtection` (404 means none, 403 means it cannot be read), and check
  runs carry their app slug.

  CLI: `bridge check` prints whether the library is protected and where to fix it. It never changes the exit code;
  `--offline` (or `BRIDGE_OFFLINE=1`) skips it, and `--json` adds `protection`.

  MCP: the server instructions say every write goes through a branch and a pull request, never straight to the
  default branch.

- 1e78f3b: Roles by team: `governance.owners` may name GitHub teams (`"@acme/design"`) as well as people, so a company assigns
  roles by team and manages membership in GitHub. Still no database.

  Core: new `teams.ts`. `parseOwnerEntry` reads a person (`"theo"`, `"@theo"`) or a team (`"@org/team-slug"`);
  `loadConfig` and the JSON schema reject anything else with the entry named and both forms spelled out.
  `TeamDirectory` expands teams to logins through any client with the new `GitHubClient` methods
  (`listTeamMembers`, paginated; `getTeamMembership` for one person; `getAccountType`; `listOrgTeams`), cached for five
  minutes. A team it cannot read is a typed state (`no-token`, `missing-permission`, `not-found`, `personal-account`,
  `unreachable`) with the fix in `teamUnreadableMessage`, never an empty list: it keeps its place in the expanded lists
  and matches nobody. `approverLists` and `shipPolicy` take the team states; `whoCanShipSentence` names a team with its
  size ("Only the tech owner can ship this (@acme/web (4 people)).").

  CLI: `bridge check` lists the teams named as owners with their size and reports each team it cannot read, with the
  fix (never part of the exit code). MCP: `bridge_get_review` returns `roles`: who may approve design, approve tech and
  ship, with teams named, and an approval counts when the reviewer is in the team.

  Studio: approvals, who acts, the ship gate (with a membership check for the viewer), the Overview and History
  count team members and name teams as teams. Settings, Review rules gains Design owners and Tech owners rows: a team
  is a chip with its member count and avatars, a team that cannot be read gets one sentence with the reason and the
  fix, and Edit takes a person or a team (a DS Combobox suggesting the organization's teams and the repository's
  people), sent for review on `bridge.config.json`.

### Patch Changes

- 196d02b: Real branch preview URLs and install commands everywhere, never guessed ones. On exploration #64
  (`explore/button-normal-again`) Vercel shortened the admin and Storybook aliases with a hash
  (`bridge-admin-git-explore-button-norm-0ed5ba-peterbonos-projects.vercel.app`), so the template URLs were wrong.

  Core: `branchPreviewUrls(client, prNumber | sha, config)` reads what Vercel reports, in order: GitHub deployments of the
  head commit, the Vercel commit statuses (state of each deploy), the Vercel bot comment (`[vc]` header, decoded), and the
  `previews.apps` template only when its host label fits in 63 characters. Pure parts: `parseVercelComment`,
  `findVercelComment`, `appForProject` (Vercel project to app by the template host), `resolveBranchPreviews`,
  `previewLinksOf`, `previewsSettled`. `explorationTestBuildOnGitHub` returns the install command from the preview comment
  and the real previews in one read. `GitHubClient.listCommitStatuses` and `listDeployments`. The sticky PR comment
  (`previewComment`) takes the resolved previews and never prints a shortened template URL. Removed: `explorationInstall`
  and `ExplorationInstall` (guessed pkg.pr.new commands); `StartedExploration.install` becomes `tryIt` and
  `ExplorationSummary.install` is gone (it gains `headSha`).

  Preview packages workflow: the comment's preview table uses the URLs Vercel reports (deployments, statuses, its comment).

  MCP and CLI: `bridge_list_explorations` / `bridge explore list` return the install command from the preview comment
  (`install.state` building, ready or failed) and the previews Vercel reports; `bridge explore start` no longer prints a
  pkg.pr.new command.

  Studio: the pull request detail ("Preview and install") shows the URLs Vercel reports and the command the workflow
  published, or that the test build is being prepared; the exploration detail fills its previews the same way.

  DS Bridge plugin: the exploration result screen ("Try it") shows the real URLs, checks every 15 seconds for up to 10
  minutes while it is open (stopping once the command and every preview are ready), updates in place without
  re-rendering, and keeps "Check again".

### Minor Changes

- bac1cb2: Measure design system adoption in product code. `@bridge-ds/core/audit` finds hardcoded colors, lengths, radii, shadows, durations, z-index and fonts in CSS, SCSS, style/sx/styled/theme objects, CSS-in-JS and Tailwind classes, suggests the closest token (deltaE in OKLab across every mode, nearest scale step), and counts DS components against foreign UI libraries, native elements and re-created components. `bridge audit <path>` reports token and component adoption as JSON (versioned schema) and Markdown, compares with a baseline, fails CI under a threshold, and `--fix --write` replaces exact CSS matches with `var(--token)`. The MCP server adds `bridge_audit` and the `migrate-file-to-ds` prompt. New `@bridge-ds/stylelint-plugin` (`bridge/use-tokens`) and `@bridge-ds/eslint-plugin` (`no-hardcoded-style-values`, `prefer-ds-components`).
- bffaaa9: History and rollback. `bridge_get_history` and `bridge_get_token_history` read what changed in the tokens (versions, merged PRs and commits, who, when, why, tier, breaking), and `bridge_plan_revert` and `bridge_propose_revert` undo a change against the current base branch, with conflicts shown when a token changed again later, or restore one token to an older value. The CLI adds `bridge history [token]` and `bridge revert <pr|commit> [--dry-run]`. Built on the new history model and revert planner in `@bridge-ds/core`.
- ee19cd7: Bridge MCP server and CLI. `@bridge-ds/mcp` connects Claude Code, Claude Desktop or any MCP client to a DTCG design system repo (local folder or GitHub): 15 tools to read tokens per mode, search, validate, check contrast, read components and docs, propose token changes as branches or draft PRs (never on main), review PRs and scaffold components, plus resources and prompts. `@bridge-ds/cli` adds `bridge init`, `check`, `tokens`, `diff`, `propose` and `mcp`.
- cd5565e: Visual impact analysis for design system changes. `@bridge-ds/core` gains a usage index (CSS variables each component reads, components it renders). New `@bridge-ds/visual` builds Storybook and the admin app at two refs, screenshots the impacted stories (every brand and theme) and the admin screens (every tenant and theme) deterministically, and pixel-diffs them into before, after, diff and composite images plus a JSON manifest. `bridge impact` and the `bridge_visual_impact` MCP tool run it; a workflow posts the result on pull requests.
- d5d263b: Docs drafts. `@bridge-ds/core` computes what code can tell about a component's docs (props table, tokens, anatomy from the CSS module classes, contrast notes, a changelog line) and keeps the review state of AI-drafted prose (`draftedBy`, `needsReview`). The MCP server adds `bridge_draft_docs`, which returns that pre-fill and a prompt for your own Claude to write the prose; the CLI adds `bridge docs draft <Component>` (`--json` for CI).
- 525217f: Explorations for Claude and the terminal: MCP tools `bridge_start_exploration` and `bridge_list_explorations`; CLI `bridge explore start <name> --purpose`, `bridge explore list`, `bridge explore promote <name>` and `bridge explore close <name>`. Write tools take a target exploration branch: `bridge_propose_token_change` and `bridge propose` with `branch` (one commit on GitHub, or the checked-out working tree locally), `bridge_draft_docs` with `branch`, `bridge_get_request` and `bridge request implement` with `branch`, `bridge_create_request` and `bridge request create` with `exploration`. Briefs for an exploration say to work on that branch and never open a pull request to main.
- 5c40693: New brands, from every surface. `planNewBrand` in `@bridge-ds/core` builds a brand file (primary and neutral ramps from the shared ramp engine, the starting brand's radius, fonts and theme overrides), adds the slug to `modes.brand` in `bridge.config.json`, and runs the contrast gate for the new brand in light and dark. The CLI gets `bridge brand create` and `bridge brand list`, the MCP server `bridge_list_brands`, `bridge_plan_brand` and `bridge_propose_brand`, the Figma plugin offers a new Brand mode as a new brand on Push, and the Studio has a four-step New brand flow with a live preview. The token build reads its brands from `bridge.config.json`, and `scripts/ramps.mjs` runs the same ramp engine (primitives unchanged).
- e31bac2: Publishable under the @bridge-ds scope: a `source` export condition for the monorepo, built `dist` with types,
  publish fields, and part of `npm run build:packages`. @bridge-ds/core also ships its `./audit` and `./node` entries.
- 2c79d5d: Component change requests for developers: MCP tools `bridge_list_requests`, `bridge_get_request` (with a brief to implement the request) and `bridge_create_request`; CLI `bridge request list|show|implement [--claude]|create`; and `bridge request jira-sync` for the optional bridge-jira GitHub Action. Pull request summaries from the core GitHub client now carry the body, so requests link the pull requests that close them.

### Patch Changes

- a55525d: Bridge brand moves to the "Field Guide" direction: white content, ink text, Harbor zones and Deep Harbor as the one strong color, Fraunces headings over Instrument Sans text, rounder radii. See `docs/DESIGN-LANGUAGE.md` (v2).

  Why this is major for `@bridge-ds/tokens`: the default brand changes what existing tokens resolve to, and consumers must check their screens.

  - Palette roles re-pointed in the bridge brand: `palette.neutral` from steel to the new `color.ink` ramp; `palette.primary`, `palette.accent` and `palette.link` to the new `color.harbor` ramp; `palette.info` from cable to plum. Orange is now only the categorical chart hue (`palette.categorical`).
  - `color.bg.default` is white (`palette.neutral.0`) in bridge light. Ocean keeps its tinted canvas, links and zone through `brands/ocean.light.tokens.json`.
  - Primary action and checked controls move to `primary.700` (hover 800, active 900); links to `link.700` (hover 800); `color.signal.default` to `accent.600`; `focus.ring.color` to `accent.700`. Dark: actions and checked controls use `primary.300/200/100` with `primary.950` text.
  - `font.family.sans` is Instrument Sans in bridge (was IBM Plex Sans).
  - Radius roles in bridge: inset 6, control 12, container 20, overlay 20 (were 2, 6, 10, 14). Primitive `radius.xl` is 12 (was 14).
  - Primitive `font.size` steps changed: `300` 17 to 16, `400` 20 to 21, `600` 29 to 30, `700` 35 to 36, `800` 42 to 44, `1000` 60 to 64.
  - `control.height.md` is 44 in comfortable density (was 40) and 36 in compact (was 32).

  Additions: `color.bg.zone` (Harbor blocks, light `primary.200`, dark `primary.900`, ocean light `primary.50`), `font.family.display` (Fraunces in bridge, Plex Sans in ocean), `font.family.fraunces`, `font.family.instrument-sans`, `typography.<display|h1|h2|h3|body|ui|caption>.{size,line-height,weight,family,tracking}` in both brands, `font.leading.{16,20,26,28,32,38,50,68}`, `size.11` (44px), and the `color.ink.*` and `color.harbor.*` ramps with pinned brand anchors (ink 200 `#E3E8EE`, 600 `#5B6672`, 900 `#15202B`; harbor 200 `#CFE8FF`, 700 `#0B4A8B`). `contrast.checks.json` gains 5 pairs on `color.bg.zone` (296 checks, 0 failing). Fixes a missing `$type` on `color.bg.zone` in the semantic light and dark files.

  `@bridge-ds/react`: no API change, but every component's rendered look changes through the tokens (colors, fonts, radii, 44px default controls). PageHeader, Card, Dialog and Drawer titles read the new `typography.*` roles; medium Badges set at 14/20 (the `ui` role), small Badges stay 12/16.

  `@bridge-ds/docs-site`: the Bridge site wears the Field Guide brand. Top bar of five items, a short side nav (no headings, no counts, collapsible groups), Harbor header blocks on Library section pages, new Library home and Studio overview, version chip by the page title, branch picker by the Studio title, brand and density in the preview toolbars. The theme playground is removed; `/playground/` redirects to the Library home. `.stylelintrc.json` accepts `var(--typography-<role>-family)` for `font-family`.

  `@bridge-ds/core`, `@bridge-ds/cli`, `@bridge-ds/mcp`, `@bridge-ds/eslint-plugin`, `@bridge-ds/stylelint-plugin`, `@bridge-ds/figma-plugin`: test expectations and fixtures follow the new token values (ink chains, white canvas, the ocean overrides, 296 contrast checks). No behavior change.
